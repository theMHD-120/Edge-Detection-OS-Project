Each image:
With n * m pixels 
>>> n: rows
>>> m: columns 

image matrix = [
[[R00, G00, B00], [R01, G01, B01], [R02, G02, B02], ..., [R0m, G0m, B0m]],
[[R10, G10, B10], [R11, G11, B11], [R12, G12, B12], ..., [R1m, G1m, B1m]],
[[R20, G20, B20], [R21, G21, B21], [R22, G22, B22], ..., [R2m, G2m, B2m]],

Test both fully and partial multithreading (for different pictures) and see the result:
>>> Total taken time
>>> Obtained edges image
